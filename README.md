### Abstract
Prolonged environmental stress reshapes the relationships between primary producers, parasites, and predators within marine systems. Stress simultaneously disrupts phytoplankton physiology, as well as grazing pressure and parasitic infection, which, together, alter the structure of marine food webs and carbon sequestration potential. Predicting carbon flux in changing oceans, requires that we understand how multiple stressors impact the interaction between microbial community structure (i.e size, composition), and their susceptibility to grazing and infection. Within  a global change mesocosm experiment, we assessed changes in composition, and size distribution of  microeukaryotes, rates of Labyrinthulomycete infection, and prevalence of protistan grazers following a simulated bloom event. Under stress conditions predicted with global change, bloom magnitude was suppressed and communities were initially dominated by larger cells, but were eventually outcompeted by smaller cells following a decline in cell densities. Community succession also shifted towards an earlier dominance of heterotrophy and mixotrophy under stress. Infection by Labyrinthulomycete parasites was as high as 62%, and showed little treatment specific differences. Taken together, our results demonstrate the complex interactions of hosts, parasites, and grazers, and suggest that environmental stress drives a systemic shift in microbial community function that favors recycling over export, with significant consequences for carbon flux in oligotrophic oceans.
